# UFL input for formulation of Poisson equation 3D

# Both the electric potential, phi, and the Volume charge density, rho, are in CG.

cell = tetrahedron

family = "Lagrange" # or "CG"

degree = 1

element = FiniteElement(family, cell, degree)

phi  = TrialFunction(element)
phi_ = TestFunction(element)
rho  = Coefficient(element)

a = inner(grad(phi), grad(phi_))*dx
L = rho*phi_*dx
